# Hotel-Management-system

As the project name suggests; this project is the computerized version of the manually operated hostel management. <br>
We can improve the efficiency of the management system and avoid the errors that are often made in the manually operated hotel records, and using it provides quick access over the data.<br>

## Features:
•	Admin login and admin dashboard: It has admin login who has the authority of the system and he is responsible for approving and disapproving the users request for room booking. Admin can add and delete notifications and updates in the system.<br>
•	User Registration: There is user registration form available where new users can create their account by providing required information to the system.<br>
•	Booking System: User can request for the table booking for a particular date and time.<br>
•	Approving/Disapproving Request: The booking requests are directly sent to admin account by the system. Admin can view all the requests along with respective user details and therefore make decisions for cancelling the requests.<br>

•	Add a new room <br>
•	Remove a room<br>
•	Allot a room under a certain category <br>
